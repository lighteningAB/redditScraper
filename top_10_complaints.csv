Summary,Count
after 10 years using pixel phones and then an s22ultra i switched to an iphone the 16 pro my reason for switching is that it is an ecosystem that works together my tipping point was when i was shopping for whole house speakers and the choice was sonos or apple products sonos recently went from top offering to worst based on software a rant for another sub i went with the apple product tried to make it work with my samsung s22 wife s android her ipad and mine that was the straw that broke my back went out got two new iphones upgraded her ipad everything works together i always despise people who blindly worship iphone and resisted the switch because i didn t want to be associated with that foolishness but here i am apple is not going to fold or do stupid shit anytime soon to screw up the product line or software security is suddenly a concern with the new political environment too apple get higher makes there as well.,9
tl dr switched to android in the last few years and i love it you get far more value from android phones and the android os options are all just as good as ios these days also many android phones have way better battery life and charging speed i ve used iphones for many years tried android a couple times but always felt the software was not as effective and reliable as ios then i tried again about 6 years ago and noticed android caught up a lot still was hard to switch because in the u s many people have iphones and it is a pain to switch texting was not as good between iphones and android could not facetime video call either many comments from op on here explain why getting people in the u s to use whatsapp is very challenging about 2 years ago i tried again and things changed android phones all mostly use rcs messaging and it is just as good as apple s imessage i realized it is apple that was the one being difficult while all the other smart phones companies make phones and software that more or less work with one another also apple finally has rcs messaging now too so aside from the green bubble thing which is just a superficial thing that apple does there really was no reason for me to stick with apple anymore iphones are good don t get me wrong but you get just as good if not better for far less money with android phones also the chinese phones like oneplus have insanely fast charging and that is a game changer i can t go back.,9
i am on the android side came from using an iphone for the last 10 years most of my friends in the us prefer texting with default messages app with the ios 18 update on my recipients phone rcs has been a better experience for them on my end i didn t see much difference other than being able to react to their messages and reply to them i do prefer android over iphone because of the relatively better customisation and options no forced upgrades or getting into the ecosystem i have an ipad pro and airpods i will continue using and upgrading them because the competition is not there yet especially for tablets.,4
left iphone in 2017 but i still have my working 1gen ipad pro that i use as a tv i couldn t stand the whole lightning connector issues because i lost so many of those cables had to buy them from apple they were getting expensive so when iphine x came out with another lightning connector the price was so high a galaxy note 8 was an easy solution with dual sim expandable storage a stylus pen i can just do so much more with an android but i am recently hating google messages mostly google in general samsung needs to just come out with a google free alternative to android i had a friend try to charge their iphone 15 or 16 with my battery bank it didn t work although it s usb c so things like that is why i won t switch back to iphone.,4
the only good thing about iphone for me is imessage and health yes rcs exists on both iphone and android but that requires the iphone user to activate it and even then it s buggy sometimes my messages are sent as rcs and other times it s sms regardless of signal the health feature is much more snappy and informative compared to for example samsung health it also seems more accurate with steps and calories burned if i line up both devices with a fit bit other than that i m always going to pick android over apple.,4
i replaced my iphone 15 pro with a pixel 9 pro xl but replaced android with graphene os immediately and de googled as much as i could life is good and i m loving the control i have over my content the fact that there s an open source adless alternative for damn near everything is great prob won t be going back to ios again now.,4
i left from iphone 13 to samdung galaxy s24 ultra and i can honestly say i would never ever go back to apple the quality of life features and customization of everything is sooooooooo much better i mean yes it took me a few months to like it but after that i fell in love also i m happy to not have iphone like almost everyone i want a redmagic phone as well because they look super cool lol.,3
i think it s about how our telecoms structured billing back in the day texts were cheap or even free data was expensive people got super used to using the default messaging app as a result trying to get most family members to download another app when this one works just fine is like trying to convince them to make a massive life change.,2
Concerns about camera functionality and performance.,1
hi thank you for your answer it s pretty difficult to find a good price for a used samsung flip 4 in my country so unfortunately i don t really have the budget to spend on an extra phone to try it out also it wasnt really popular so its really hard to resell about the oppo was really satisfied at the beginning and then things went downhill after a few months battery became really bad even after doing everything to optimize it screen is really marking a lot tried to call the service but basically went kinda bankrupt in europe so they didn t help at all now it lags a lot overheats lots of bugs for the money i invested in i am really disappointed i was really careful with it tho so i don t really know what happened but apparently oppo had a lot of issues on this one less with the pro version it seems.,1
