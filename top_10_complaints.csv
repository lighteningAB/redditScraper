[FEATURES] If taking pictures is not your main objective then go with Nothing Phone 3a Pro. It has snadragon processor.,16
[CAMERA] Thanks. I m even considering the Nothing 3a now too as it s 160 cheaper and yeah I m not too bothered about camera quality.,6
"[SOFTWARE] That s quite sad. The nothing phone 3a will get support until Android 18 it seems. With how android 16 is on the verge of release it will be short-lived support for it. You can probably go without those updates, but in my case I like having the newest version around for the features and security. But you re right in not overstepping your budget, the phone market is designed to make you feel like you need to upgrade.",3
"[PERFORMANCE] I am an iPhone user so maybe take my view with a pinch of salt. Based on what I have read, Samsung s24 might be the best option given it is highly reliable. briefly had s23 and it was a great phone . Pixel seems like a lottery, some people love their pixels while others complaint about call drops, trouble with Android auto connectivity, phone heating up or battery not being great. Nothing phone again had reviewers saying performance wasn t great with stuttering. But then I think it has good software, good battery life and decent cameras. you may want to go with nothing phone 3a though since the pro isn t much of an improvement above the 3a.",2
[BUILD] Thanks. That s a good point about the Nothing 3a over the 3a pro. It s 160 cheaper here. I ve never had a Samsung before but they seem really popular at the moment. It seems like everyone I know has one.,2
"[BATTERY] I bought nothing phone 3a on release and i love It. It feels like a flagship but cheaper than flagship phones. It has a personal identity that a lot of brand don t have. The OS Is smooth and beautiful. The performance are good, not top level but good enough to play everything on play store and It doesn t overheat at all. The battery Is very good too, It lasts me around 1,5 days. I bought the 256 GB version, i think it s worth for 50 more.",2
"[FEATURES] HELP Nothing 3a Stuck in Bootloop After Root Attempt by u Economy _Topic _5370 in androidroot Oh look a Nothing 3a post, maybe I can find some help here...",1
[PRICE] I never used a nothing phone so I cant speak on experience. But I did have a50 phone in the past. I would go with the 3a based on specs and price over the a56. Since the a56 more expensive in most regions. It does have a leg up over the 3a with 6 years of os security updates compared the 3a 3 os and 6-year security updates. In my experience the a50 lags hard after the 2 or 3 os update. Nothing s skin looks to be lighter in comparison. Compare Samsung Galaxy A56 vs. Nothing Phone 3a - GSMArena.com.,1
