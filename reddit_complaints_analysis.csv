I quite like the duo both the 3a and 3a Pro I didn t mind the 3a Pro when I first saw it but I must say the triple camera setup on the 3a seems more advanced than the 2a s minion eyes while more designed more elegant than the 3a Pro That said I still vastly prefer the distinct glyph interface of the phone 1 and 2 I ve been looking to snatch one up in the states What will happen to the main line I hope they aren t dropping the large glyph lights for the 3a Pro series,1
3a looks quite nice honestly Still can t quite get around the 3a pro s camera setup though,1
The phone has significant colour shifting while changing between all 3 lenses lens flares lack of 4k in ultrawide and selfie camera no charger in box Besides that the value proposition is pretty good and the design is definitely striking The 3a pro has very little to justify it s higher price compared to the 3a imo,1
6 77 inch screen Are human hands getting bigger or is everyone legit just using their phones like tablets now,1
Why is there a 3a budget line but no 3 flagship,1
I wonder if the bootloader will be unlocked,1
Wish they also made a smaller version,1
I love the plastic back on my phone 2a plus It s grippy and weighs less Wished they kept going with it on their a series instead going the more premium route,1
You get what you pay for but at least it looks different,1
So when does the 3 drop,1
Was looking at their product page It s a bad sign when their example photos look really bad They re barely mid range A chip on par with the 870 and mediocre cameras This is a mid range phone from 2022 with AI slapped on,10
i m in the market for a mid range phone but looking at the specs i wonder if i will be better off getting nothing phone 2a,1
No wireless charging I can understand but 3 android updates is unforgivable,1
Almost bought 3a but no eSIM stopped me Need it when travelling The 3a Pro has it but I don t need the periscope camera so why pay so much extra for eSIM,1
Very elegant as expected,1
3a Pro looks worse to be honest,1
What was the point of using a periscope lens for a mere 3x zoom Don t other phones already have 3x zoom non periscope lenses,1
Should I get the 3a for like 23 000 in India or should I go for the OnePlus 12R for about 29 000 The 12R has killer hardware for the price but I m not a fan of the direction Oxygen OS has gone in I do love how nothing OS looks like but there s quite a few things lacking in the hardware section as well as the absence of a fast charger in the box and also no Alert Slider,1
I was looking at Nothing when I shopped around for a new phone but their stupid lack of NFC instantly excluded them from selection Good to see they ve fixed that part,1
No L5 and E5 gps I m disappointed,2
I do find it kinda shitty how they had a couple of youtube videos going on about how great the periscope camera in the Nothing 3a is only to finally reveal it and it s only on a 3a Pro which is a 150 more expensive,1
I wonder if they will drop prices to remain competitive against the Redmi Note 14 Pro 5G which you can pick up today for around 235 USD,1
How do we get Verizon to support this phone,1
wish they went with an 8gen2 or something else for the SOC,1
OnePlus Nord 4 is better,1
What s the best deal I can get on a 3a Any extensions credit card offers or anything whatsoever All suggestions welcome,1
No jack no buy,1
I dont think they are dropping the main line But you can get the 3a at launch in the States I just checked,1
Ultrawide seems like a downgrade,1
I am going to use minion eye as name for my 2a from now on,1
That look is growing on me,1
The pro camera bump is massive There s quite a number of phone with the same 1 1 56 main 1 1 95 periscope and their bumps are modest x200 find x8 gt7 pro 13pro 14pro,1
I think it looks a little better if you imagine it like a silly face,1
which phone would you suggests around that price with good camera,1
I think most people two hand their phones so the latter is the answer As a one hander I kind of hate it BUT that s been the nice thing about foldables can get both big and small screens in one device,1
I ve got very small hands I ve had to use phones almost exclusively with two hands since the Galaxy S3 If the phone will be impossible to use one handed for me either way might as well get as big screen as possible,1
I remember seeing the original galaxy notes 5 3 inch screen for the first time and laughing at the absurdity of it,1
Bigger phones makes it easier to watch videos imo I went from a Pixel 7 Pro 6 7 in to a Pixel 9 Pro 6 3 in and I miss my Pixel 7 Pro s screen size whenever I watch videos,1
you are in the minority especially for the budget segment if you want a relatively smaller phone you re gonna have to shell out for an iPhone or a Samsung S series,1
Same feeling Every phone I hear about these days is 6 7 inches minimum I would buy a Nothing compact phone in a heartbeat but Carl Pei himself said that there is no real market demand for one,1
Idk man I m struggling to find anything close to the size of my Pixel 4a these days I don t mind a slightly bigger screen but I can barely reach the top of my screen one handed as is,1
I remember times when HTC HD2 with its 4 3 inch screen was considered too big,1
my thoughts exactly lol I mean shit I m on a Pixel 6 by far the largest phone I ve ever owned and it s not that comfortable to use Would have 100 gone with something like these new nothing phones if they weren t bigger,1
Remember the original Note release getting slammed for it s MONSTER 5 3 screen Now even something like the Vivo X200 Pro mini is 6 3,1
Any 6 1 modern phone feels tiny to me I have a 6 6 phone and still wanted it to be bigger at least 6 9,1
I miss the old corner one hand mode My thumbs are too short to reach to the other side of the screen with the newer half a screen tall but still the same height one hand mode,1
Eh I get what you mean but you have to think of the new aspect ratios and the overall screen to body ratio 2025 6 7 phones are essentially the same physical size as 6 4 inch phones from 5 6 years ago and 5 8 6 0 from a decade ago,1
I went from a pixel xl down to the regular One handed was getting annoying with the xl phones,1
I wish 6 9 inch displays became the norm,1
I feel you this has been driving me nuts for years The only thing that helps a little is using one handed mode with my keyboard I think because more and more people are using their phones as their primary media device for gaming movies and TV bigger and bigger screens are often preferred It sucks,1
On the contrary I miss phones sizes like the Huawei Mate 20x with its 7 2 inch screen Something about consuming content on big screen makes it better,1
It s nice seeing things made that are usable for people above 5 5 in any product,1
it s insane the size of the smartphones at least samsung and pixel have flagship close to 6 inches,1
The 3 was supposed to come out last year But they pushed it back to develop their AI software more,1
ngl I though the nothing s design makes their phones look allot smaller than they actually are,1
Plastic is good as long as it doesn t feel cheap but have you held metal phone Now that s peak material,1
Wont lie dont know enough about the chipset to make a educated opinion But benchmark wise this chipset in other midrange phones gets beat out by oneplus 9 a phone released 4 years ago I guess you are paying a price premium for software support but id expect something a bit faster,1
Are you really bitching about a midrange phone with midrange specs selling for a midrange price Like you realize this isn t a flagship right,1
how big is the price difference in your region I think the 3a pro is competitive in the U S,1
2a has a cheap panel and blacks look green in dark rooms,1
Yes exactly the same here Need esim but no interest in the giant camera hump That decision will cost them some sales,1
yeah for 75 more I don t think the periscope telephoto is worth it compared to the normal 3a,1
He got a thick booty,1
A sensor around 3 times bigger than in non periscope 3x cameras,1
As the other guy said using periscope mechanism enable the oem to use bigger sensor if compared to non periscope mechanism,1
I d say the OnePlus 12R is definitely the better buy here Significantly better hardware for the same price Also OOS15 looks pretty cool and runs really well It s got some minor niggles here and there but overall it s a significant improvement over OOS14 I have a OnePlus 13,1
Not only there s no charger in box it charges very slowly 12R is much better phone at that price But it does have curved screen,1
I don t think I can give you a knowledgeable recommendation since I live in the states since my market is very different But if you re concerned about hardware here is a GSMArena link comparing both phones I hope this helps,1
Huh I have the 2a Plus and it has NFC,1
If I had a nickel for every time a phone starting an series associated with Carl Pei has no nfc I would have 2 nickels which isn t much but weird it has happened twice,1
Almost no midrange phone release have USB 3 0 Though they should make it illegal to still release any phone with USB2 0 nowadays,1
doesn t the nothing phone 2 use that,1
How does your Xperia 5 IV hold up,1
You know what else is MASSIVE,1
Depends on which market you re in in my market Moto edge 50 neo if camera is your priority Poco X7 Pro or Iqoo Neo 10R if performance is your priority,1
Interesting never thought about this So it seems that the people who really want small phones are those who could comfortably one hand formerly medium size phones And everyone else has adjusted to the current large phones every company sells,1
My wife laments the end of the iPhone Mini series Was hoping the 16e was closer to that size than it is,1
Screen size isn t the only important factor here Those old phones like the note 2 make modern phones look tiny on the width Attached is the size comparison of the Nexus 6 vs the modern giant s25 Ultra Nexus 6 vs S25 Ultra,1
The first cell phones were massive because the technology at the time restricted them from being small Then technology advanced in the cell phone got really small Then people figured out that you can watch porn on phones and then they got big again,1
And once you reach a certain age reading text on your phone is easier on larger phones,1
Why even call them phones anymore if their primary function is pocket video monitor We could abbreviate it poke mon,1
Xiaomi Motorola Google all have at least one small phone,1
I don t understand how there s not market for smaller phones in lower budget phones yet flagships from Samsung every year still have 6 2 model If that sell how come cheaper small phones don t I don t understand,1
There is market demand because Apple have both base iPhone and Pro iPhone Samsung have base S model Google have base Pixel a and non XL Pro Even Chinese oem like Vivo make 1 Oppo OnePlus rumoured to release 1 too following Xiaomi s base model,1
I assume the 6 3 screen of the Pixel 9 is still on the too large side,1
That s why I bought a S23 it was the most P4a ish sized phone with acceptable specs,1
Same wish they d make more midrangers at that size hell even make some 7 2 phones for media consumption,1
I wish we could stop having norms,1
Is that even a phone I looked it up looks like tablet lol,1
Ugh I m so sick of this forced AI trash The 3a 3a Pro having a button that basically just opens a voice dictation AI is fucking stupid I just hope the button is remappable to it s not a waste of space,1
Metal just feels more premium but still prefer plastic for practical reasons Metal gets too hot or cold and is more slippery,1
Are you capable of comprehending what i wrote I m complaining that it s a midrange phone from 2 3 years ago and priced as a new midrange phone I really wish some of you would learn to understand what you re reading instead of just making up whatever you want in your own head,1
i think here i can get a 2a for around 200usd thereabout,1
Genuinely might push me towards Motorola They have great availability here in AU and now offer 5 yrs of updates 2 more than Nothing and a near stock OS and eSIM on most models When they drop a successor to the Edge 50 Neo I ll probably cop as I don t want any of their curved models,1
Telephoto is a nice inclusion but really hinges on how well their isp tuning is since it s a debut for Nothing,1
Linus s quick comparison shows the selfie and rear shooters are remarkably better on the Pro,1
Thanks for the recco Ended up getting the 12R although bank discounts didn t apply for some reason and I paid 32 500 in total Still a good deal imo,1
Yeah not a fan of the curved screen Design wise the 3a is great but I need a balance of a nice design and solid specs which I think the 3a is lacking I m thinking to purchase the 12r for now and exchange for a flagship Phone 3 or Phone 4 in a year or two,1
Thanks Btw is the OnePlus 12R selling in the American market I thought it was exclusive to India,1
They were probably interested in the cmf phone 1,1
CMF 1 doesn t,1
It s really dumb I can t imagine making a daughterboard with USB 2 0 instead of 3 2 or whatever saves any meaningful amount of money I think for most brands it s just another way to artificially distinguish their lower tier options from their higher ones But Nothing has never made a phone with USB 3 x so I have some reason to doubt the Nothing Phone 3 will have it either,1
Phone 2 uses 8 gen 1,1
Decent phone but not my fav Probably better off in the hands of someone who knows how to operate a camera,1
Well the nothing phone 2 did get an American release Maybe look for old stock,1
Can I ask why the Glyphs seem to have such an appeal to you They re just a bit of a novelty for me on my Phone 1 which I ve been very happy with,1
Someone s maternal relative,1
many punch carpenter imminent apparatus summer waiting crown automatic bag This post was mass deleted and anonymized with Redact,1
Medium sized phones meant 3 5 screens at one point so you re technically correct,1
Even that was 5 4 Bigger than the original Galaxy Note,1
Yeah for some reason every single of these annoying small phone fans just completely ignore the concept of huge freaking bezels and aspect ratios,1
Very impressive Now do the normal S25 with the HTC Dream and Nexus One,1
Because that s what they started out as and continue to be lost peoples primary line of communication I E We have phone numbers There is no primary function in smartphones i think smart devices or even just devices are better names they are powerful multifunctional mobile computers They do everything So you may as well call them by their original primary function which continues to be somewhat exclusive to these devices,1
Name one Because a small phone is around 5 at this point,1
If that sell how come cheaper small phones don t I don t understand Smartphones are not just the primary but in many many cases the only computing device people own obviously it mainly happened in developing countries initially but IMO it s increasingly the case in developed ones as well If phone is your main device with which you not only do boring stuff like pay for things or log into work related apps but also endlessly scroll through websites and social media pull up recipes when cooking watch videos or even movies TV shows you want the screens to be as big as possible Poorer people are more likely to not own any bigger device like a tablet laptop or a desktop so they on average want the biggest phone possible,1
As far I know Motorola is the only one that release small midrange phone Even that phone isn t really small having 6 4 screen,1
That s right Samsung is one of the only ones who do that anymore Apple used to do it until they abandoned the mini Pixel s a line still does a relatively smaller one but it could go up to 6 3,1
For me personally yes but in the future if I have to upgrade and if literally no other choice exists but that size I ll pick it I still have a Pixel 5a and at 6 34 inches it s hard to use and doesn t fit in my pocket very well,1
What s your opinion about the s23 I m a pixel 4a owner and there s literally nothing like it around in terms of size weight and specs but after that awful January update I want need to switch,1
I feel like I am the only person with all of that shit disabled as much as possible,1
That has a MediaTek chip I m not as well versed in their low end midrange chips Maybe look around nothing s 2a community with how the chip has held up,1
just get OP 13,1
Another phone you can consider is OnePlus Nord 4 That one should be even cheaper,1
Yeah it s sold in the u s just before the 13r got released We were getting pretty good discounts with the top tier was selling for 500 which is a solid deal imo,1
Ah alright Well with all due respect that s a cheap low end phone many of those don t have NFC,1
Honest answer is that it will not be my primary device and I want it for the soft surround lighting that I use on a nightly basis A regular smartphone flash light works fine but I sometimes catch the reflection off glossy surfaces and mirrors around the house and it s annoying I ll admit my situation is rather unique and I can t explain it much better than that I sometimes just want to use the phone s flashlight instead of turning on the lights around the house at night But the glyphs offer a nice middle ground for soft fill lighting that sounds appealing to me I may be willing to spend 379 for that novelty or preferably less for a used phone 1 2 but likely not more than that I m currently using an S24 and I much prefer the smaller size for a secondary device Like my Pixel 6 Pro the Nothing Phones all are a bit too wide and heavy for my taste as a primary device but I would like to get a used phone 1 for cheap and get full glyph lighting,1
Yes and no really Even tho yes the screen size is bigger in numbers because of changes in aspect ratio and screen to body radio the iPhone 13 mini physically smaller than the Note or Note 2 Using 19 5 9 or something similar combined with the fact that the bezels aren t enormous means that it still qualifies as a small phone even with screen sizes getting bigger Yes its still bigger than an iPhone 4 and stuff like that but those were literally tiny and a 3 5 phone would be miniscule in a modern aspect ratio and small bezels The of the screen doesn t give you the full information without knowing the size of the bezels and the aspect ratio the phone is using Which is why 5 5 in 2013 is huge whereas 5 5 in 2025 is very small This is why stuff like the phonearena size comparison tool is useful for comparing phones that are theoretically the same size but not in practice A Note or Plus or XL or Ultra or Max phone is always going to be big for its time in same way a Mini or Compact phone is always going to be small for its time,1
No we don t I have a 6 3 inch phone and it is massive I cannot one hand this thing like I easily could with older smaller phones Quit bsing about aspect ratios and bezels Modern phones are huge Even that nexus 6 is big with a 6 inch screen that he s comparing to I still have my old phones and there is just no comparison to the size and weight of my current phone,1
Yeah that s crazy I really don t think I could enjoy any app on something that small these days Some of it is my eyes have gotten old,1
Can you share the app website you used for the comparison,1
Unihertz Jelly Max,1
Pixel 9 is 6 3,1
I m happy with it nothing to complain about,1
It s the first thing I did when I set up my new phone If you re on a Pixel there s AI Core AI Wallpaper and Android System SafetyCore to disable or uninstall in your apps list At least on the 9 series I assume older as well though,1
That device got a lot of traction and had many people interested in trying Android with it It was one thing that people had to have nowadays,1
Some of the chinese brands have nfc in their budget phones,1
I feel there must be alternative torches or night lights you could look into but hey it s your money,1
There are two conversations worth having Small phones have gotten really huge and are not all that small I agree with that The conversation I was having was that big phones back in the day were pretty fucking wide when compared to modern big phones,1
THANK you The Nexus 6 was marketed as a Phablet same as the Galaxy Note and small phone fans like myself were already complaining about the size of the Nexus 5,1
A great suggestion but not from those three companies lol,1
I own a Jelly Star which is even smaller Downside is bizarre boot loop issues on occasion and absolutely 0 software updates,1
I wouldn t say Pixel 9 is a midrange Tbh Pixel 8a deserve more if you want to put it,1
OK but in terms of comment OP I was originally replying to talking about fixing that part and stupid lack of NFC it s not necessarily because Nothing hates NFC OP surely has seen other non Chinese phones in that price range not have NFC either I don t understand how it makes sense to talk about fixing NFC in the 3a after only having looked at the low end option,1
They have NFC in phones cheaper than the CMF Phone 1 Real shame they left it out,1
Yeah definitely but I feel like it s my way to justify adding a quirky phone to my collection,1
There literally is nothing from those three companies,1
Yeah even Samsung has NFC in phones cheaper than the CMF 1,1
3a Pro Basically the Nothing Phone 3,1
The 3a camera module is just weird The 3a Pro looks fine I like both but I get that tech styles like this aren t everyone s cup of tea,1
Well it sure is unique,1
I like it,1
They are so over priced in my country,1
For once I d love a phone that s just a slab Professional cameras Great software Slab camera bump gone,1
they got rid of the micro sd,1
Looks like they asked Carl Pei s kid to position the camera lenses,1
Good lord that is ugly,1
Selling a phone with an 8MP camera sensor in 2025 is a crime What were they thinking,1
Rectangle with camera woooo All that being said I think Pixels are the best looking phones so far The rumored iPhone redesign even attempts to look more like them I think phones have pretty much reached their end state and it s a mature market now The cameras are all good enough processing power is all great other than some extremely demanding games but does anyone really wanna play Re4 remake on their tiny phone screen The steam deck and switch and the like are just better experiences for that I don t see where phones can really improve from here by much Perhaps just focusing on battery and efficiency and making them last a week without charging It doesn t bother me much plugging it in at night I think the next frontier for tech is 100 going to be something along the lines of the vision pro or those meta smart glasses The idea I have is of having that battery pack cable they have and being able to plug into a phone and use that device s battery and processing power to be able to offload more from the glasses But the prospect of full on computing shared AR experiences not needing monitors anymore That would be something,1
Hmm weird button placement I m not a fan,1
Certainly different It s not for me but it is a different type of design that I m sure others will find appealing,1
So now we have a 2a 2a plus and 3a 3a PRO Will there be a 3a plus pro or pro plus as well,1
They look cool The naming scheme makes zero sense though 3a Pro Like a midrange phone but pro,1
Nothing is so infatuated with these little drip releases Say what you will about the pixels leaks or whatever but I think it s nice that you basically know what you re getting so you can make an informed purchasing decision,1
that s the ugliest fucking thing ive ever seen,1
i think the nothing phone is the dumbest android smartphone by far hey lets bring back the notification light back only on the back bingo lets make millions any other idea s 2 usb ports no sim loads of storage switchable battery na just a light on the back just that genius,1
They look cool and all but the amount of people I have seen complaining about screen issues like green tint and black crush sometimes both on the same phone and weird bugs and UI issues like lag and stutters Why spend money on these when Samsung Oppo and other manufacturers offer you more for less The led lights will most likely loose their charm in a week The performance of the device matters in the long term and SHORT term,1
It s kind of clicked now When that first quirky Nothing phones released I thought it was cool but I still preferred the neater looking competitors But not that it s been a few years I am so fucking bored of them Will await the price but this is on my radar this year,1
So does anyone actually seriously use the glyph lights,1
I still don t quite get Nothing s USP market approach I love having more competitors in the space and appreciate their hardware aesthetic but otherwise they re just building extremely mediocore phones using off the shelf parts with a basic and extremely unappealing ugly Android skin And I guess some lights on the back That s kinda it I just don t really understand why you d buy one vs the myriad of other devices on the market which are far more competitive Carl talks as if they ve got these groundbreaking things coming but every release is as dull as the next,1
Why is the camera looking so bulky I always thought my Pixel 6 s camera would stick out too much This looks like it s even worse and it s also a mechanical mechanism that rotates so that is another potential failure,1
Why more than 6 3 Just why,1
Never understood why people like this brand so much just because of their name,1
Anyone know if it shoots in RAW,1
I am a bit confused does the 3a pro replaces the 3pro,1
it s so damn ugly looks like a smarphone made by AI,1
Would be funny if this was a fake render planted by Nothing like the 2a render,1
I like the way they both look but that camera module on the 3a Pro is hideous and triggers my trypophobia,1
i might buy just to support,1
capacity battery the 6 77 inch 120Hz display lol OPPO just put out a foldable with a bigger battery than this,1
Nice to see 3 usable hopefully cameras in this price range A lot of manufacturers pack in a useless 2mp macro lens that no one uses just to up the number,1
Interesting if the camera is better than the one on my x80 then I might upgrade,1
These are obviously not coming to the United States so I have little reason to care since I live in the US I know most people on this sub are Indians or Europeans though lmao,1
The 3 a pro why does it exist Like a pro version of a midrange phone Edit if the nothing team read this I know you guys are on here Genuinely interested to know I know you ll have a reason I m just itching to get my hands on the phone 3,1
Mountain Dew Diet Double Dew Edition,1
Separate phone though at this point I wonder if it has any other upgrades besides the SOC,1
I mean the cpu on the 3a pro barely improve the performance of the regular 2a it would be weird to call that a flagship only the cameras deserve a pro naming,1
Idk the 3a Pro s camera placement looks really haphazard I still don t get why Nothing hasn t figured out how to integrate the flash as one of the Glyph lights,1
Assume you mixed them up The weird one is the 3a Pro,1
I literally said yuck and visibily cringed when I saw the renders It s definitely not my cup of tea,1
Still better than pixel 9 looking like amongus guys,1
I thought the 2a looked awesome I understand the camera placement being controversial but apart from that it s a very unique design,1
It s subjective like all design Huge camera array of mostly empty space They somehow made it worse than the other Nothing Phones which had a more subtle circular area Part of it s the huge lip this time around Or how the glyphs that appear to be an after thought more so than prior models Nothing is striking out here They seem adrift They aren t releasing their phones in logical order e g no Phone 3 jumping straight to 3a to compete with Google s Pixel branding Second they pulled dirty tricks in their unveiling video with the camera tests to make iPhone look much much worse than this phone Which begs the question why are the constantly comparing their phone to the top flagship phone This is squarely aimed at budget middle market devices That s why they have to cheat to look better,1
It looks unique and fun There is thousands of boring phone nice there is new funnier brand,1
Sony Xperia is closest,1
wait for pixel 9a or iphone 16e,1
They didn t have one from the beginning,1
Looks like they wanted to differentiate their phones too much that they strayed onto weird category,1
Have you seen their YouTube video comparing this phone the actual device blurred out in the video like it is something secret and scandalous to the iPhone Nothing cheated and was deceptive in their real world comparison They got called out by their own fans because they did things like choose the iPhone s ultra wide lens and placed it in a dark setting so it was optically zoomed way out and grainy while setting the Nothing Phone 3a to its peak settings non ultra wide no digital zoom unlike what they did with iPhone They forgot to blur or not show the camera settings being used on the iPhone in the viewfinder which gave them away I really really like their UI design I like an underdog But being so brazen and underhanded really turned me off of the brand If they will be deceptive about little stuff like that and undermine their entire credibility since they aren t a luxury phone maker why should I trust them on bigger stuff 8MP is too damn low which his why their had to deceive people Shitty tablets that are definitely cheaper than this phone have higher megapixel cameras,1
Repairability and upgradability still leave a LOT to be desired I may sound radical by phrasing it this way but simply put as the climate crisis continues to eat up coastal cities we will become more conscious about how often we are replacing things we purchase Having a Framework phone if you re familiar with the framework laptop it is entirely modular and upgradable across all hardware where you can replace the battery and screen and upgrade the camera modules etc etc that s where this all must lead If it comes in the form of goggles or glasses or whatever that is fine But they mustn t be made in a way that requires habitual purchases The trash simply doesn t go anywhere and there s a point of no return that we will eventually reach in terms of the amount of trash we produce and what it does to the earth air and ocean Again I totally understand I sound a bit out there and radical but this is the unfortunate reality and we already see that reality influencing laws such as a customer s right to repair Apple being forced to adopt USB C to essentially eliminate proprietary phone plugs etc But eventually hard to repair glass sandwiches won t suffice and either customers or environmental circumstance will force a change,1
Next we ll be integrating buttons back into mainstream lol blackberry resurgence,1
Asymmetric maybe But ugly I think not It definitely has its own unique style and personality,1
It s like they generated it with craiyon and were like yup that ll do,1
Yeh I don t get the glyph lights I got my kid a 2a cos I thought he d be impressed by the lights and shit He s had them turned off ever since he got it lol,1
Nope The glyph lights needs to go and replace with something more useful,1
Why is that surprising Bigger phone means more space for battery,1
2a is available in the US,1
Trial run a periscope before they put it on on their phone 3 they haven t even done a regular telephoto before,1
definitely bigger ultrawide than a dinky 8MP,1
Likely also wireless charging and esim,1
Maybe their AI stuff,1
You can actually use glyphs as flash light already,1
I probably did That article s photo placements aren t great,1
These are the opposite of sleek is all More turning to a pure cyber industrial aesthetic,1
I m in a country that s VERY pro Apple and VERY anti Android yet on 3 different occasions I ve seen someone using the 2a and on 2 different occasions I ve been asked about my Nothing Ear 1s people can make fun of Pei for copying Apple so much but holy shit does it actually work I m all for it tbh my mom wanted to get a phone for her home business I suggested the 2a she loved it his time at OnePlus has surely taught him that selling to sweaty tech enthusiasts doesn t make money selling to the average consumer definitely does,1
Using 2a now it does attract some attention I have people asking me what phone is that especially when scanning QR codes,1
I own a 2a and I wasn t a fan of the design at first but it has really grown on me I think the 3a design just doesn t work Not terrible or anything but with the extra camera it s just like a slightly deformed Google Pixel It doesn t have the eyes anymore it s not as unique and the camera bump looks too far down The 3a Pro looks really good thought I hope it will have a white version,3
I am but I m not hopeful I have an iPhone right now but I m itching to jump back to android Just waiting for that perfect phone There s some foldable sim really digging I had the z fold but it just didn t hit the right spot The latest oppo has me drooling but the damn camera bumps Sony too has me considering it but too tall My iPhones hitting the upgrade age again Hopefully this year or next I get the android I want,1
Tf do you mean how,1
Like my ex girlfriend,1
After the initial oh that s different you realise they re on the wrong side to be useful and pretty childish,1
It s not really bigger by terms of volume N5 is 4 21mm lol this is likely gonna be around 8mm,1
Wasn t it only a limited sale I know 3rd party Amazon sellers offer it here unofficially,1
My experience is Ultra Wide looks arse no matter what never use it on my One Plus 11,1
That would be a major downgrade if itbhad wireless charging Waste of internal phone space and cost bloat,1
Having no esim is what s stopping me from buying a nothing phone,1
No wireless charging they say,1
Yeah but I m sure the vast majority of their AI is just using Gemini or open AI stuff white label and then maybe some tweaks Just like Galaxy AI doesn t really use any Samsung proprietary generative AI models It s not to say they can t do anything interesting but I would temper my expectations Especially since as we see with the s25 ultra you need to have 4 GB of RAM always at the ready that can t be used for anything else to accommodate Galaxy AI And Google say hi with Gemini So like the s25 ultra with 12 GB of RAM effectively is only 8 GB of RAM if you don t care about AI If you re not using the AI it s not like the phone can take those 4 GB of RAM and use them for anything else Gary explains as a great video about this and it makes me really frustrated that Samsung only included 12 GB of RAM especially since stuff like the Note 20 ultra and the Note 10 Plus at 12 GB of RAM,1
Damn that s impressive what country if you don t mind me asking,1
N5 is 4 21 on each side So double that,1
I don t think it s going to be anything interesting if it is their AI solution but I do kinda think they re forced to have one if the reports statistics suggest people do want AI stuff on their phones I personally don t care for it,1
the UAE anyone that makes above say 2000 a month I d say 80 chance they use an iphone anecdotally when Huawei was on the rise people started switching to Huawei phones then the ban happened and the last time I ve seen a Huawei phone was the P30 Pro,1
Which is barely thicker than this is gonna be Maybe 5mm thicker With a smaller screen Volume wise it s smaller than this nothing phone,1
Oh that s pretty interesting given the wealth disparity there,1
yep I work in retail and out of 22 of my coworkers 20 have an iphone old or new doesn t matter funnily enough we don t have the same iMessage problem the US has cuz when WhatsApp was gaining popularity in 2011 2012 the market share was maybe 20 30 iPhone while a good 30 40 used BlackBerries and the rest used either Samsungs or Sonys so iMessage never really took off here WhatsApp was available on all 3 platforms and was also free those stats are purely pulled out of my ass but that s what I remember seeing and experiencing first hand iPhones didn t gain strong popularity until maybe the iPhone 6 s that Rose Gold finish was an instant success,3
That s interesting like in the US 90 of high school students use an iPhone And I remember back in 2013 I was at an ad agency digital media department and every single person in the department except me had an iPhone I think 17 people,1
Must admit i really getting confused with the way they are naming these latest Nothing phones,1
I m thinking of replacing my Pixel 6 with either a device from the 3a series or the Pixel 9a but the 3a Pro feels a bit underwhelming for its price I m eagerly looking forward to the 3a review,1
The lyt600 not being able to do 4k30 or even 1080p60 is really damning It would be understandable if it was the base 3a My current phone using the same periscope sensor on a weaker 7sGen2 can do 4k30 Nothing s first foray into telephoto is off to a shaky start,1
My current phone is a Nothing I haven t been that impressed with it for various reasons I m considering buying a BlackView phone next as I just like the idea of a rugged phone with a big battery and I just like the idea of a thermal camera built in That said I might be making the same mistakes again,1
The S24 FE seems like a better buy for most imo I got one myself on sale for around the same price as this phone and it has both a longer amount of promised software updates and a better chip,1
So this gets a rating of 4 3 the same as the Galaxy S25,1
Based on my eyes I can ten the 2 stands for the two cameras and the 3 stands for the 3 cameras but that s just an observation cause then why did they never come out with a 1 with one camera,1
wish these were on sale on the google Fi store,1
HELP Nothing 3a Stuck in Bootloop After Root Attempt by u Economy _Topic _5370 in androidroot Oh look a Nothing 3a post maybe I can find some help here,1
I d love to support Nothing in their mission and bringing competition The YT videos they make are pretty cool But until they release a smallish sized phone I don t see myself owning one It s a shame but maybe one day it happens,1
Liking mine so far,1
I can t deal with 256gb storage with no micro SD They either need a 512gb version or allow it to have microsd Because of those limitations its not really a pro phone,1
Yeah 3a pro is a pro version of the budget version except the non budget version doesn t exist,1
I haven t been this confused since the Nexus 6P and 5X came out at the same time,1
This of the Samsung A series as nothing a series and Samsungs S series as their digit series The phones that they released are lite phones the flagship is yet to come out,1
3a pro definitely is underwhelming for its price even more so when its only marginally better chipset performance than the 2a plus like sure it has better cams and other newer stuff slapped into it Im so fucking pissed that they replaced DM7350 for SD7s G3 and alot of reviewers i see are just then saying that ohhh 3a is upgraded from 2a because its now snapdragon not dimensity anymore oh hoo hoo SD7S is supposed to be qualcoms 2nd tier flagship it barely outperforms mtk s 3rd tier chips on max performance not even better in power efficiency and is blown out by DM8000 series Carl really should have stuck with dimensity on his a phones damn maybe this is just a dimensity glaze post,1
Wait for pixel 9a after using a Pixel other phones will feel buggy or underwhelming,1
hah i have a blackview BL8000 and consider moving to an nothing phone because im unhappy with the blackview its to bulky some features dont work stepcounter NFC paying the batterylife is nice but last couple of weeks its been draining much faster as in you need to charge at the end of the day,1
your self awareness is wholesome lol,1
The regular 3A is a much better value buy,1
Idk how it makes sense UFS 2 1 No wireless charging No increase in battery capacity or silicon carbon battery No 5 6 of software updates Front camera is still 1080p Back camera still doesn t support 4k 60,1
Right and then you look at the photos from the main camera it s really not up to par for a 450 phone the sunny photos are burned and the ones in the shadows are soft and noisy Video wise it s pretty meh as well The specs aren t that good either for the price at least compared to chinese phones It s really comes down to that periscope telephoto best in class easily but a telephoto doesn t make a phone,1
I just want an s25e,1
Judging by the specs it doesn t seem worse but hardly any improvements at all,1
256gb is indeed too small especially if you re expecting to use it for a few years,1
i heard nothing phone 3 is coming later this year what is that suppose to mean the A in 3A means alpha or something,1
They called their better last 2a 2a Plus And then switched it now to Pro,1
I find it hard to justify the pro name and the 80 jump in price from 379 to 459 based on the spec sheet The two are identical except for the telephoto camera 32MP vs 50MP selfie camera 8 128 vs 12 256 of RAM storage and 201 vs 211g in weight Nothing says the primary sensors are different as well but not enough info on that front,1
I think the confusing thing is that with both a modifier that essentially means less the a and one that means more the Plus Pro it s unclear which modifier is stronger and thus how 2a Plus should compare to a regular 2 particularly if one is newer,1
Lol OnePlus 13r costs 650 in Europe,1
The design of that phone is shit,1
You definitely have it backwards here,1
Got my first pixel 9 device and I can t recall the last time a phone has been this buggy at launch and with subsequent updates,1
Well all I ll say is no other brand of phone I ve owned has ever rebooted randomly while I m using it That said the last firmware seems to have improved a lot and I m hoping it stays the way it seems to be right now,1
Relative to price my bro,1
it makes sense because it s mid range not a flagship line,1
Spec for spec wise it s just the Realme 14 pro but with worse screen battery ip rating ufs storage And the 14 pro have some rather attractive price in some markets,1
costs half as much as the S25,1
Doesn t work with ATT correct,1
I agree that 4k 60fps is a basic spec these days but it is absolutely not a feature anyone needs in their phone 60fps is meant for slow motion use mostly used for B roll shots that are slightly slowed down If you shoot in 60fps and watch in 60fps it s very uncomfortable with how smooth the motion looks You can tell an amateur YouTuber who buys a camera based on specs instead of knowledge by whether their video is in 60fps,1
Because price trumps every other feature Most people are not buying the best but what they can afford,1
Especially calling something pro,1
It s probably like the Pixel a series 3a 8a that is just a cheaper and cut down version of the main series phone,1
It s a stupid naming scheme but the Nothing Phone 3 should surpass or equal the Nothing Phone 3a Pro in every way,1
Don t know what the A means But the Pro stands for Pro fit,1
Was it actually better I heard it was because the obscure mediatek chip they were using wasn t being produced anymore so they just made a different model,1
The storage and ram different would justify the increased price not saying the price is ok for the specs but it is a better camera double storage and more ram,1
3a pro supports esim 3a doesn t,1
Is 3a pro is much better Design is subjective but sheesh,1
It s hardly impressive even for the price Got my Moto Edge 40 in 2023 for the same price and that had 1 Faster storage and processor 2 4k recording support for the selfie and ultrawide 3 Better ultrawide camera 4 Wireless charging faster 68w wired charger that came with the phone 5 IP68 rating metal frame The 3a pro makes no sense given the only difference between that and the normal 3a is just the periscope camera They could ve done better to differentiate the Pro variant,1
Realme 14 pro doesn t even have app opening and closing animations It feels like using a powerful phone in 2017,1
people with 1200 phones don t even record in 4k60 the average social media user doesn t do it essentially nobody does it besides niche scenarios people aren t buying nothing products for 4k60 or camera in general they re doing it for an interesting phone and software experience look at their YouTube page they openly admit to not being concerned about hardware price performance they care about the experience of the phone People in this sub simply refuse to remove themselves from spec sheets and use context to form opinions,1
The price is awfully close to couple years old premium models Like I d pay 50 extra to get S23 over this easily Or just buy something cheaper then this,1
The D7200 D7350 are very much the same chip except just high clocked might just come from the same binned batch They also threw in some fluff like better selfie charging And upping the price just because,1
The battery life is significantly better,1
The Dimensity 8020 isn t any faster than the Snapdragon 7S Gen 3 in CPU and it s slower in GPU performance plus it s probably less efficient At least the Dimensity has AV1 decoding shame on Qualcomm at this point but the Moto Edge doesn t seem to have Ultra HDR support,1
how is the software experience does motorola filled their phones with bloatware like realme,1
There is a little bit more than just the telephoto but yeah I find it hard to justify the pro name and the 80 jump in price from 379 to 459 based on the spec sheet They are identical except for the telephoto camera 32MP vs 50MP selfie camera 8 128 vs 12 256 of RAM storage and 201 vs 211g in weight Nothing says the primary sensors are different as well but not enough info on that front,1
I have the 13 pro and it does have animation unless 14 pro is somehow special,1
How are those two devices even remotely comparable The market has shown that people would prefer a big phone when given a choice If you said the plus that would make sense but then again they are nowhere near a similar price,1
They re both 5000mAH Have you had both,1
Well we can agree about the circular camera but disagree about 13r vs 3a pro They re about the same to me haha but 13r is a better phone imo,1
Dimensity 8020 scores higher in Geekbench 6 multi core and slightly lower in single core In 3DMark it scores higher for GPU benchmarks compared to the 7s gen 3 8020 should be less efficient but keep in mind that it s an ancient SoC launched in 2021 and yet it s as fast as if not faster Which makes the 7s gen 3 look even worse in comparison Something like the Dimensity 8400 would run circles around it and you get that in phones cheaper than the Nothing 3A,1
Stock OS with no bloatware whatsoever,1
Animations are limited to the flagship devices on Realme What you have on 13 pro is app closing animations but not app opening animations for example same goes for 14 pro Just Google it or check r realme,1
I have the 2a Plus not both But every review I ve seen has the plus with a solid lead in battery life I left my 23U for the 2a Plus and it s SIGNIFICANTLY more efficient with its 5000mah,1
Would hope it was since it costs 120 more,1
Oh yeah it does What a disappointment from such a recent SoC,1
Oh wow I see Thank you,1
Interesting Why did you decide to switch from flagship s23u to 2a,1
I ve honestly kinda given up on finding an Uber Phone at this point and decided that the 1 thing I want out of a phone is battery life long enough that I genuinely don t have to worrying about making it through a day If I get off work 5pm and decide to meet up with friends afterwards I don t want to worry about topping off before I go I just want the BEST battery life possible on android If the phone feels smooth to operate and the camera captures pictures well enough and speakers don t sound like shit I m good Best I could tell the 2a Plus fit the bill best and since I ve been using it about 2 months now the battery life has been everything it was hyped up to be I actually went back the 23 ultra for a day or two just because I thought I d rather have the wireless charging with worse overall battery life but I was appalled by how quickly the battery drained and went right back to the 2a Plus,1
Is it wild that a phone released today doesn t have wireless charging Even newer cars today have wireless charging pads,1
UFS 2 2 Seriously,1
Interested to see how it compares with the upcoming OnePlus Nord 5 That one will most likely have a bigger battery and faster charging but I m not sure about the camera,1
7s Gen 3 is weaker than a 4 year old snap 8 gen 1 Let that sink in And they re advertising this phone as having flagship specs lol,1
Any details on camera HW beside mpx Like what sensors are they using Are they SONY or Samsung or Omnivision,1
the pixel 6a from what 3 years ago has ufs3 1,1
what would you choose between samsung a56 and 3a,1
I got real confused and thought Phone was Pixel like didnt that phone come out 10 years ago,1
And That Carl Pei guy has audacity to say as if done something praiseworthy and will touch the grass per his linkedin post,1
mediocre at best,1
Not even a Snapdragon 8 gen 3 no 80W fast charging and the battery of 5000 mAh is kinda just average in 2025 A serial dual cell battery setup would ve been awesome I was hoping it would ve been something that finally moved me over from the OnePlus Just make a 650 700 phone,1
guess they needed to cut corners somewhere and this was part of it how much could they be saving by not going for at least UFS 3 1,1
Where is this spec indicated In Italy it is marketed at 3 1,1
Is the display same as 2 a,1
What s the difference between periscope and non periscope zoom,1
No way really Are mid range chips this stagnant now This combined with UFS 2 2 is really disappointing I might just pick up a used Phone 2 instead,1
The ultrawide is Sony on both The main sensor is Samsung on both The Telephoto on the pro is Sony lyt 600 This was all in the community post I just shared,1
My educated guesses based on Mpx count sensor size details and info OP gave you 3a Main sensor Samsung GN9 Tele presumably Samsung JN5 UW Sony IMX355 Selfie Samsung KD1 3a Pro Main sensor Samsung GNJ Tele Sony LYT 600 UW Sony IMX355 Selfie Samsung JN1,1
I never used a nothing phone so I cant speak on experience But I did have a50 phone in the past I would go with the 3a based on specs and price over the a56 Since the a56 more expensive in most regions It does have a leg up over the 3a with 6 years of os security updates compared the 3a 3 os and 6 year security updates In my experience the a50 lags hard after the 2 or 3 os update Nothing s skin looks to be lighter in comparison Compare Samsung Galaxy A56 vs Nothing Phone 3a GSMArena com,1
It is not their flagship They said that Phone 3 will also release this year This one might have those features,1
It s a 380 dollar phone,1
Hell UFS 3 0 is 6 years old and while it was kind of an outlier and had compromises elsewhere Poco X3 Pro had UFS 3 1 for 249 back in 2021 But Nothing isn t unique in stubbornly sticking UFS2 2 to their midrange phones,1
Balancing size and quality Phone 3a and Phone 3a Pro s displays are immersive and brilliant At 6 77 inches their flagship size means on screen content has room to breathe Slightly taller and with less rounded corners than past Nothing phones Phone 3a Series displays represent a maturity and confidence befitting of a second generation device At Full HD resolution visuals look crisp with 387 pixels in every inch of screen and with a fluid 120Hz adaptive refresh rate The standard touch sampling rate is 480Hz a 100 increase from Phone 2a and 1000Hz touch sampling rate when in Gaming Mode swiping through Phone 3a Series is smooth and responsive Fire up auto brightness and your Phone 3a climbs up to 1300 nits all by itself making it viewable under a scorching sun But peak brightness now reaches 3000 nits a 131 increase from Phone 2a nothing community,1
periscope is a lens design that allows for bigger lens sensors by putting them on their side This allows phones to have better quality at longer ranges While a non periscope is set up normally like a main sensor The issue is that it s feasible with telephoto lengths and have good quality,1
I actually believed they would make a mid high range phone Maybe I expected too much for the 3rd iteration Not saying it s not a good value for those who aren t power users but I would love a 5400 5600mAh phone with fast charging in the form of a Nothing phone,1
Thank you I keep waiting,1
Damn thanks for your source 3a got WAY less interesting now,1
Sorry if my question wasn t clear I am more concerned about display type they used in 2a it s the worst OLeD I have ever used under low brightness I couldn t watch any content at all it all looks masked or smeared especially when it s dark room and content is also dark and phone brightness set to low Many posts in nothing subReddit regarding the same,1
If you don t care about the tele camera then it s straight up worse in that department selfie camera is also a lot smaller and still only does 1080p video,1
The 3a does support fast charging from what their website is showing,1
That will probably be their Nothing Phone 3 This is successor to the 2a,1
That really isn t a big deal unless you plan on frequently moving files between your phone and computer Most networks will limit you before UFS 2 2 chips throttle Even then write speeds hover around 250MB s It would only take a few seconds to transfer an HD movie If you re using an inexpensive 2 0 cable the transfer speeds of the cable will throttle anything over UFS 2 2 as well,1
Oh I m sorry I don t know I would say look at the reviews Maybe they talk about that,1
It looks to be a new and much improved panel in the 3a Green tinge in low light is gone,1
Np and good luck on your phone search journey,1
His point in this video about Nothing being unique for not gatekeeping zoom telephoto lenses behind premium models was so spot on Hopefully it sets a direction for the rest of the industry I have no need for a high end SoC but do need longer focal lengths,1
The limited availability in the US is a bummer just because There s enough competition at this price point where it s probably going to be a deal break So many limited features and band support I understand their motivations though it s expensive to enter the US market and it s so dominated by Apple and Samsung that there s not that much to gain So I understand it But it s a shame because this would be on a short list but the limitations just would make it hard to stand up next to a 12R or a 13R or a 9a or a Moto razr,1
MQB jumped the shark so high you re gonna need a bigger shark,1
Marques has reviewed pretty much everything including that cheap smartwatch Nothing has made At this point he s either an investor in Nothing or he really owes Carl Pei,1
Marques seems to make a video on pretty much every nothing phone I guess they do really well,1
What was it that he did said that jumped the shark,1
Or maybe in a smartphone era where reviews of the major manufacturers Apple Samsung and Google have essentially been same phone last year with AI and 100 200 dollars more expensive Nothing makes for better content during off season,1
You know OEMs send phones for free to reviewers right,1
It s a marketing for them They send a phone MKBHD reviews it Even if its average like 7 10 its a win for them I like these new phones might try and make a switch from Poco F5 I reeeaaaally like the blue color but after not liking my blue poco very much I might opt for black one,1
Could be the Panels wallpaper thing Or driving fast in a restricted area Unless there was another one which I missed,1
Yeah except he also just reviewed the iPhone 16e and Powerbeats Pro 2 He s also skipped a lot of devices over the past few months like the Vivo X200 Pro Oppo Find X8 Pro Galaxy Z Fold 6 Xiaomi 15 Ultra Oppo Find N5 even the new Razr s among many others His Apple bias has long been evident and it has nothing to do with views at this point and the person you replied to made a fair point that Nothing benefits from a similar bias,1
Are you serious You mean MKBHD gets these phones for free from different manufacturers but then decide to review every device made by Nothing but then refuse to review a OnePlus flagship device,1
It s a marketing for them They send a phone MKBHD reviews it What a novel strategy I m sure no other company has done this before s Seriously though he has a choice on whether to review the products or not and Nothing along with Apple are the only companies he seems to review every product they offer,1
You think there s a company out there that doesn t send their phones to Marques At the end of the day if Marques doesn t think the videos will perform then he simply won t invest the time and money into making them There s a reason he doesn t make a video on every poco phone for example,1
Most of the phones you listed won t be officially available in his country,1
Yes why are we talking about MK and not the phones,1
He reviewed the Oneplus phone though is he paid by then also,1
Other than the 15 Ultra and Find N5 he has access to the others either via the market or review samples He s already shown that he has both the Find X8 Pro and X200 Pro he mentioned them in his smartphone awards video Equally CMF by Nothing only sells their products in the US via Amazon yet that hasn t stopped him from giving the CMF Phone 1 his value award,1
You tell me,1
He reviewed the Oneplus phone though is he paid by then also Don t be an idiot He had to walk back by his refusal to review OnePlus 12 after people called him out for reviewing a new iPhone colour and not a OnePlus flagship He had no qualms about reviewing OnePlus devices until Carl Pei left the company Suddenly he s too busy to review OnePlus phones but has the time to review every device that Nothing makes including a budget smartwatch that only 3 people in the US would be buying,1
you talking about Marques and not the phone specs performance,1
It s a really good upgrade I d say But personally I would look at other alternatives if they better tickle my fancy,1
for processing no doubt 7 is cool i am confused regarding camera specs in real world scenarios for photography and videography,1
Depends on what you need If u want high performance heavy gaming and high battery go for infinix gt20 pro Nothing phone 3a is more like a casual phone or your daily driver It has decent camera great OS and decent battery So choose if you are heavy gaming or just your everyday phone,1
Win for the 3a imo The only thing I don t know about is if you re doing heavy gaming But I think in terms of CPU there s not a big difference between the two,1
enough for what what do you mean,1
I have never had nothing phone so I am thinking if it is a downgrade from a 888 processor,1
Normal phone tasks yes Gaming Not so much,1
Seems a little weak for the price I assume I am intrigued by it the cameras the os the battery but seems in the same league as my old realme GT2 I don t play games but I like the smooth experience by a fast processor,1
More than good enough for regular gaming and emulation just not the best option for the most demanding games Nothing phones usually have good cooling which is also great for longer gaming sessions,1
